# Technical Interview Practice

## Week 2: Strings

0️⃣ **Set up HackerRank and Leetcode**

Make accounts at [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com)

1️⃣ **Practice problems: STRINGS**
Today we'll be working in groups of 3 to complete the questions on Leetcode/Hackerrank. 

- Person 1 is the driver (share screen, types)
- Person 2 and 3 are contributors (brainstorm ideas, watch for typos, etc.)
- Switch after each problem.

Treat all three of these as conceptual practice (aka choose an editor that allows you to run your code).

1. Use the string cheatsheet that you made over the weekend.

2. Warmup on HackerRank: [Complete this to get a sense of the interface](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/solve-me-first/problem).
